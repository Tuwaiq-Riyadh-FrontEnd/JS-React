## CSS Positioning

Positioning is what makes us determine where elements appear on the screen, and how they appear.
You can move elements around, and position them exactly where you want.
In this section we'll also see how things change on a page based on how elements with
different `position` interact with each other. We have one main CSS property: `position` . It can have those 5 values:
- static
- relative
- absolute
- fixed
- sticky

Open **position.html** in VS Code and try positioning items.
