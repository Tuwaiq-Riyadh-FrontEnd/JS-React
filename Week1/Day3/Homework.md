# Week 1 Day 3 Home work


### Functions
Create a file with name Week1Day3FnHw.js. Inside this file:
* Create a function that will get the sum of the numbers between 1 and n and return the answer 
`summation(5)` // should return 15 because 1+2+3+4+5=15
* Create a function to get the sum of all the even numbers in a group 
`summationEven(5)` // should return 6 because 2+4=6

### Rolling Dice

For this home work, you'll be creating a page that displays a random update of two dice every time the user hits the "Roll Dice" button. To get started, open the [app.js file](Labs/dice/). Use the HTML and CSS code included in the Home work folder.
