* Print every number from 0 to 10

* Print every number from 10 to 0

* Print every number from 4 to -16

* Print every fifth number from 8 to 41

## The classic Fizzbuzz Program

For every `number` between 1 and 100...

If the `number` is evenly divisible by 3, print "Fizz"

If the `number` is evenly divisible by 5, print "Buzz"

If the `number` is evenly divisible by 3 AND evenly divisible by 5, print "Fizzbuzz"


## The even/odd reporter

Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").
## Fibonacci sequence:

Write a program that prints the first 20 elements of Fibonacci sequence:

- Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers, and the first two elements are 0 and 1

- It starts like 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ..

## Squares of numbers

using for loop print the squares of numbers from 1-10

## The Grade Assigner

Assign a grade and log it based on a score that you provide as variable and according to the grading system shown below. for example your log should show "For 89, you got a B." or "For 90, you got an A.", etc.

| Score      | Grade       |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| 90-100          | A  |
| 80-90 | B        |
| 70-80    | C        |
| 60-70        | D          |
| less than 60    | F        |
